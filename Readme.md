# What is this
A decoder for the zstd compression format as defined in: [This document](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/doc/zstd_compression_format.md).

It is NOT a compressor. I dont plan on implementing that part either, at least not in the near future. (If someone is motivated enough I will of course accept a pull-request!)

This is currently just a work in progress project that I might never finish. Use/fork at own risk ;) It does work correctly at least for the test-set of files I used, YMMV.

For production use (or if you need a compressor) I would recommend to use the C binding located [here](https://github.com/gyscos/zstd-rs).

# Current Status

## Speed
Measuring with the 'time' utility the original zstd and my decoder both decoding the same enwik9.zst file, my decoder is about 4 times slower. Enwik9 is highly compressible, for less compressible data my decoder comes close to only being 3 times slower.

## Can do:
1. Parse all files in /decodecorpus_files. These were generated with [decodecorpus](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/dev/tests) by the original zstd developers
1. Decode all of them correctly into the output buffer
1. Decode all the decode_corpus files (1000+) I created locally 

## Cannot do
1. Use dictionaries

## Roadmap
1. Make a nice API maybe io::Read based, maybe not, we'll see
1. Implement dictionary support
1. Find what causes the slow-units in fuzzing
1. Performance optimizations
1. More tests (especially unit-tests for the bitreaders)
1. Find more bugs

## Testing
Tests take two forms. 
1. Tests using well-formed files that have to decode correctly and are checked against their originals
1. Tests using malformed input that have been generated by the fuzzer. These dont have to decode (they are garbage) but they must not make the decoder panic

## Fuzzing
Fuzzing has been done with cargo fuzz. Each time it crashes the decoder I fixed the issue and added the offending input as a test. It's checked into the repo in the fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_target_1 directory. Those get tested in the fuzz_regressions.rs test.
At the time of writing the fuzzer was able to run for over 12 hours on the random input without finding new crashes. Obviously this doesn't mean there are no bugs but the common ones are probably fixed.

Fuzzing has been done on 
1. Random input with no initial corpus
2. The *.zst in /fuzz_decodecorpus

### You wanna help fuzz?
Use ```cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1``` to start the fuzzer on random data.
Use ```cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_target_1 fuzz_decodecorpus``` to start the fuzzer on files that have been created with decodecorpus. You can of course create your own corpus if you'd like to.

If (when) the fuzzer finds a crash it will be saved to the artifacts dir by the fuzzer. Run ``` cargo test artifacts ``` to run the artifacts tests. 
This will tell you where the decoder panics exactly. If you are able to fix the issue please feel free to do a pullrequest. If not please still submit the offending input and I will see how to fix it myself.

# How can you use it?
### Easy
The easiest is to just decode all blocks and then drain the buffer like this:
```
let mut f = File::open(path).unwrap();
let mut frame_dec = frame_decoder::FrameDecoder::new(&mut f).unwrap();
frame_dec.decode_blocks(&mut f, frame_decoder::BlockDecodingStrategy::All).unwrap();

// result contains the whole decoded file
let result = frame_dec.drain_buffer();
```

### Memory efficient
If memory is a concern you can decode frames partially. For an example see the src/bin/zstd.rs file. Basically you can decode the frame until either a
given block count has been decoded or the decodebuffer has reached a certain size. Then you can collect no longer needed bytes from the buffer and do something with them, discard them and resume decoding the frame in a loop until the frame has been decoded completely.

# What you might notice
I already have done a decoder for zstd in golang. [here](https://github.com/KillingSpark/sparkzstd). This was a first try and it turned out very inperformant. I could have tried to rewrite it to use less allocations while decoding etc etc but that seemed dull (and unecessary since klauspost has done a way better golang implementation can compress too [here](https://github.com/klauspost/compress/tree/master/zstd))

## Why another one
Well I wanted to show myself that I am actually able to learn from my mistakes. This implementation should be way more performant since I from the get go focussed on reusing allocated space instead of reallocating all the decoding tables etc.

Also this time I did most of the work without looking at the original source nor the [educational decoder](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/tree/dev/doc/educational_decoder).
So it is somewhat uninfluenced by those. (But I carried over some memories from the golang implementation). 
I used it to understand the huffman-decoding process and the process of how to exactly distribute baseline/num_bits in the fse tables on which the documentation is somewhat ambigous. 
After having written most of the code I used my golang implementation for debugging purposes (known 'good' results of the different steps).

## Known bugs:
1. Some (invalid! generated by fuzzer) inputs seem to take very long / for ever. They are also checked in into the directory 'fuzz/artifacts/fuzz_target_1'
